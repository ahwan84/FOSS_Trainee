Hi folks!
## Introduction
I am Ahwan Sarkar, a student of IIIT Allahabad.
### Incident abt college that I stumbled upon
This goes like-
One day all of my friends planned to go Civil Lines. But I said NO from the beginning. I was just roaming in campus. One of my them came and told that plan is cancelled. So they now planned to do some bullshit in my room. IT WAS A TRAP!!! They didn't even let me wear my shoes and carried me to auto :(. They brought shoes later, but it still IT WAS AGAINST MY WILL..... I WANT JUSTICE XD.
### Funny Joke/Incident I wanna tell
The incidents we do in hostel can't be told in public XD (things one should not do in hostel type shit). Life ain't funny lately. My insta feed is not feeding since september :( . So I have nothing to tell as a joke. But I can tell two incidents again -
I have admitted to this college in August and made some really good friends. We did many bullshit things till the date. One of the funny incident that I can recall goes as -
1. We are a group of 8 friends. One guy was sleeping in the next room. We all seven people went to his room and brought his bed alongwith with him sleeping to my room. In the meanwhile he woke up and shouted like he saw a ghost or something like that. Then we all slept in my room :D

2. A friend of mine has OCD towards food. If we touch his plate, he won't be eating in the same plate until washed ;D. So three of my frineds planned something interesting. They made lemonade. The lemons, sugar, glass, water - all were brought from mess to my room :D(shouldn't have told ig :d). Only soda water was bought. So they were making lemonade and one guy put his finger into the lemon and licked it and then inserted directly into the lemonade XD XD. Then the time came when he drank that. After that, we showed him the video of making lemonade XD. Then what ? we played holi with lemonade XD XD.
Wanna know what happened to the glass we brought from mess?- even we don't know  ;p.
