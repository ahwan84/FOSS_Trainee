Hi peers!
## Introduction
I am Ahwan Sarkar, a student of IIIT Allahabad.
## Funny incident
I have admitted to this college in August and made some really good friends. We did many bullshit things till the date. One of the funny incident that I can recall goes as -
We are a group of 8 friends. One guy was sleeping in the next room. We all went to his room and brought his bed alongwith with him sleeping to my room. In the meanwhile he woke up and shouted like he saw a ghost or something like that. Then we all slept in my room :D
## Funny I wanna tell
The incident we do in hostel can't be told in public XD (things on should not do in hostel type shit). My insta feed is not feeding since september :( . So I have nothing to tell as a joke. But I can tell an incident again LOL -
A friend of mine has OCD towards food. If we touch his plate, he won't be eating in the same plate until washed ;D. So three of my frineds planned something interesting. They made lemonade. The lemons, sugar, glass, water - all were brought from mess to my room :D(shouldn't have told ig :d). Only soda water was bought. So they were making lemonade and one guy put his finger into the lemon and licked it and then inserted directly into the lemonade XD XD. Then the time came when he drank that. After that, we showed him the video of making lemonade XD. Then what ? we played holi with lemonade XD XD.
Wanna know what happened to the glass we brought from mess?- even we don't know -_- ;p
